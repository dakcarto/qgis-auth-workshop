==================================================

2016 Girona, Spain, 2nd International QGIS Conference

This workshop introduces the new QGIS authentication system, since v2.12, its
plugin infrastructure, and how it can be used in secure connections. The worksop
will cover crafting a new method plugin to show how easily QGIS can be extended
to fit new authentication requirements for a variety of endpoints. Also included
are examples of using the new authentication system in a PyQGIS plugin and a
data provider.

   C++) and a working build environment for QGIS master or 2.14 branch. User
