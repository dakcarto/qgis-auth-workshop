Sphinx theme for Boundless documentation
========================================

This theme is shared and used by all qgis plugins documentation through the [qgis-plugins-documentation repository](https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-plugins-documentation).

Building documentation outside the above repository (that is, using the plugin's repository exclusively) will create the docs with a default sphinx theme instead.
