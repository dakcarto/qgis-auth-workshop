Data Provider Integration

Integration with OWS
--------------------

.. warning::

   Creating a new file after the first launch of will have no effect whatsoever.
   The plugin will ignore the new file and will continue to use the already
   saved repository location.

The ``$HOME/.qgis2/repoUrl.txt`` file is an INI-like text file with single
``general`` section and only one key-value pair, for example:

::

  [general]
  repoUrl=https://qgis.boundlessgeo.com/plugins/plugins.xml

The value of the ``repoUrl`` key with repository location can be:

* A **Repository URL**. The plugin will add this URL to the list of available
  plugins repositories and QGIS *Plugin Manager* can be used to access it. This
  is the default.
* An **absolute path to the plugins directory**. In this case, the directory
  should contain plugins packages as well as repository description file
  ``plugins.xml``. With this option, nothing is added to the QGIS settings, as
  QGIS *Plugin Manager* can not handle directories yet.

.. TODO:: Make an example of an XML
